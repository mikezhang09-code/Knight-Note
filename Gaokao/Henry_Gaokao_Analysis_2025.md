*Note on Benchmarks: For universities other than PKU/Tsinghua, the "强基计划" shortlist rank is not public. The rank shown is the regular admission tier, which serves as a conservative proxy. The actual "强基计划" shortlist rank is expected to be **higher (less competitive)** than this number.*

This document provides an analysis of potential university admissions for Henry, a high school student from Chengdu, based on his academic profile, interests, and achievements.


## 1. Henry's Profile

*   **Student:** Henry, from Chengdu, Sichuan.
*   **Subject Combination:** Physics, Chemistry, Biology (物化生).
*   **Academic Performance:**
    *   **"零诊" (Zero Diagnostic Exam):** Score of 687, ranking 100th in Chengdu.
    *   **"一诊" (First Diagnostic Exam):** Score of 669, ranking 138th in Chengdu.
    *   **Note:** These ranks indicate a very strong academic standing, likely placing him in the top tier of students province-wide.
*   **Achievements:** First Prize in NOIP (National Olympiad in Informatics in Provinces). This is a significant advantage, especially for Computer Science and AI-related fields.
*   **Academic Interests:** Computer Programming, Artificial Intelligence (AI), Statistics, Applied Mathematics.
*   **Career Goal:** To work in the field of Artificial Intelligence.
*   **University Preferences:**
    1.  C9 League Universities.
    2.  Top 15 ranked "985" Universities.

## 2. Admission Context for Sichuan 2025

*   **New System:** Sichuan will use a "院校专业组" (University-Major Group) system for admissions. This means universities group several majors together, and students apply to the group, not a specific major.
*   **Analysis Strategy:** The analysis will focus on the minimum admission scores/ranks for these major groups and the majors they contain. A direct score comparison to previous years is less reliable than comparing provincial ranks. Henry's NOIP award makes the **"强基计划" (Strengthening Basic Disciplines Program)** a highly viable and recommended path.

## 3. University Options Analysis (强基计划 Focus)

The "强基计划" is the most promising path for Henry, as it is designed for students with strong foundational skills and competition achievements. His NOIP award will be a major asset in the comprehensive evaluation process.

### Tier 1: Top C9 Universities

#### **A. Peking University (北京大学)**

*   **Program:** 强基计划 (Qiangji Program)
*   **Relevant Majors:**
    *   **"数学类" (Mathematics Category):** Includes "信息与计算科学" (Information and Computing Science), a good fit.
    *   **"物理学类" (Physics Category):** A strong foundational choice for AI.
*   **NOIP Advantage:** While a provincial prize doesn't grant "破格" (exceptional) admission (which requires a national-level award), it provides a significant advantage in the application review and interview stages.
*   **Verdict:** **Aspiration.** PKU is extremely competitive. The regular admission provincial rank in 2024 was ~63. The "强基计划" offers a more realistic, albeit still challenging, path. His NOIP award makes him a candidate worth considering for them.

---

#### **B. Tsinghua University (清华大学)**

*   **Program:** 强基计划 (Qiangji Program)
*   **Relevant Majors:**
    *   **"信息与计算科学" (Information and Computing Science):** A direct match for his interests.
    *   **"数学与应用数学" (Mathematics and Applied Mathematics):** Excellent foundation.
    *   **"数理基础科学" (Mathematical and Physical Basic Sciences):** Highly recommended. This track is explicitly designed to prepare students for careers in "智能科技" (Intelligent Technology) and other high-tech fields.
*   **NOIP Advantage:** Similar to PKU, the award strengthens his application significantly, especially for the interview and for majors like "信息与计算科学."
*   **Verdict:** **Aspiration.** The regular admission rank was ~85 in 2024. Like PKU, this is a top-tier challenge. The "数理基础科学" track is a particularly compelling option that aligns perfectly with his goals.

---

#### **C. Fudan University (复旦大学)**

*   **Program:** 强基计划 (Qiangji Program)
*   **Relevant Majors:**
    *   **"信息与计算科学" (Information and Computing Science):** **Highly Recommended.** This major was newly added in 2024. It offers a "本博" (undergraduate-to-doctorate) path that includes **人工智能 (Artificial Intelligence)**.
    *   **"数学与应用数学" (Mathematics and Applied Mathematics):** Solid choice.
*   **NOIP Advantage:** **Exceptional.** Fudan's university test for the "信息与计算科学" major is explicitly **benchmarked against NOIP difficulty**. This gives Henry a huge home-field advantage.
*   **Verdict:** **Strong Match / Target.** Fudan's program seems tailor-made for Henry's profile. The direct path to an AI specialization and the NOIP-aligned test make this one of the most promising options.

---

#### **D. Shanghai Jiao Tong University (上海交通大学)**

*   **Program:** 强基计划 (Qiangji Program)
*   **Relevant Majors:**
    *   Undergraduate majors are in fundamental sciences: **"数学与应用数学" (Mathematics and Applied Mathematics)** and **"物理学" (Physics)**.
    *   AI/CS is pursued at the postgraduate level. The university's AI School and other departments recruit "强基计划" students for direct PhD programs.
*   **NOIP Advantage:** Strengthens his application, but the path is less direct than Fudan's.
*   **Verdict:** **Good Match / Target.** A solid option, but requires a commitment to a longer, more structured academic path (pursuing a PhD to get into AI). The undergraduate experience will be focused on pure science.

## 4. Summary and Recommendations

Based on this analysis, the "强基计划" is the recommended application route for Henry. His profile, particularly the NOIP First Prize, makes him a very competitive candidate for these programs.

**Top Recommendations:**

1.  **Fudan University (复旦大学):** Appears to be the **best fit**. The new "信息与计算科学" major, with its direct path to an AI PhD and its NOIP-aligned university test, is a perfect match for Henry's skills and goals.
2.  **Nanjing University (南京大学):** A very close second. The option to study mathematics directly within the "人工智能学院" (AI School) is a unique and highly attractive feature.

**Excellent Alternatives (also apply):**

*   **Tsinghua University (清华大学):** The "数理基础科学" (Mathematical and Physical Basic Sciences) track is an outstanding option with a clear link to "智能科技" (Intelligent Technology).
*   **University of Science and Technology of China (中国科学技术大学):** Offers a direct path to "信息与计算科学" and is known for its high-quality, rigorous science education.
*   **Shanghai Jiao Tong University (上海交通大学):** A great university, but the path to AI is primarily at the postgraduate level, requiring a longer commitment.

**Aspirational Goals:**

*   **Peking University (北京大学):** While a top university, its "强基计划" options do not seem as perfectly aligned with Henry's specific profile as Fudan or NJU. Still worth applying to as an aspiration.

**General Strategy:**

*   **Apply Broadly to "强基计划":** Henry should apply to the "强基计划" at all the universities listed above that align with his interests. The process is separate for each, and it maximizes his chances.
*   **Prepare for University Tests:** He should prepare for the university-specific tests, especially for Fudan, where his NOIP knowledge is a direct advantage.
*   **Monitor 2025 Admissions:** Keep a close watch on the official undergraduate admission websites for these universities for the 2025 "强基计划" announcements, as details can change.

This concludes the initial analysis. Further research can be done on the Top 15 "985" universities if desired, but the C9 league already presents a wealth of excellent opportunities.
